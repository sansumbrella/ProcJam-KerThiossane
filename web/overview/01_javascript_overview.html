    ///////////////////////////////
    // Data Values and Variables //
    ///////////////////////////////

    // Javascript, like most programming languages, lets you work with data.
    // Data can take many forms, but there are a few fundamental types of data
    // that form the underlying representation of most things in our programs.
    // These types are numbers, text, and booleans.

    // Text data is represented by the "string" type.
    // Text data can be written into your program by surrounding normal text with quotation marks:
    "Bonjour";

    // Numeric data is represented by the "number" type.
    // Numbers can be written directly into your program.
    1234;
    // Numbers use the US convention for writing, so a decimal separates the ones from the tenths place.
    100.05;

    // Boolean data is something that can be either "true" or "false."
    // It is represented by the "boolean" type.
    true;
    false;
    // Booleans can be flipped between true and false by using the "not operator" "!".
    // Read the below as "not true" and "not false".
    !true;  // => false
    !false; // => true

    // When typed as above, our data is represented by the computer as "values."
    // This just means the number 1234 has a value of 1234 and won't ever be anything else.
    // Because they never change, values are easy to think about, and lots of programmers
    // try to work with them exclusively.

    // It can get pretty overwhelming to always type in your data as the exact values
    // everywhere you need them. Variables are a solution to that challenge:
    // they let us give names to the data in our program.

    // In javascript, we can store any type of data in a variable.
    // The variable is now a name that refers to a particular value.
    var salutation = "Bonjour";
    var five = 5;

    // Unlike values, variables can change.
    // This makes them useful, but can also be confusing.
    // For example, below, our variable "five" now refers the the value 22.
    five = 22;

    // In modern javascript, we can use `const` instead of `var` to prevent
    // confusing situations like the one above. When written with `const`,
    // no one will be allowed to change what value our variable refers to.
    const six = 6;

    // You can do things with variables and values, like add them together
    // to make new values.
    var sentence = salutation + ", mes amis";

    // Or do a sequence of steps to calculate a value halfway between two numbers.
    var difference = six - five;
    var halfway = five + difference * 0.5;

    ///////////////
    // Functions //
    ///////////////

    // Functions in Javascript let us do things with our data.
    // They can take data as parameters and return data as an output.
    // They can also modify the webpage they are running in, such as
    // by drawing to screen or playing sounds.

    // console.log() is a built-in function that prints data to the console.
    // To see the console output, you will need to open the javascript console (press `ESC` inside developer tools)
    // We can pass it data values directly
    console.log("Bonjour");
    // Or we can pass it variables, which it will use to get at the value to print
    console.log(sentence);

    // There are many math functions in javascript, all of which take numeric data as parameters
    // and return numeric data as an output.

    // Math.cos calculates the cosine of an angle.
    var cosine = Math.cos(3.1415);
    console.log(cosine);

    // In addition to using the built-in functions of javascript, we can write our own.
    // This lets us combine a set of operations for easy reuse.

    // By creating a mix function, we can calculate intermediate values between numbers
    // without needing to rewrite the math every time. This can help us avoid mistakes
    // from typos and also helps clarify why we are doing math.

    // mix blends between two numbers.
    // This can be useful for animation.
    function mix(a, b, t) {
        return a + (b - a) * t;
    }

    // We call our functions just like the built-in functions:
    // by appending parentheses '()' after the function's name and
    // placing any parameters to the function inside the parentheses.
    // When our function is called, the parameters passed in will have
    // the names we used when we defined the function.
    halfway = mix(five, six, 0.5);
    console.log(halfway);

    /////////////
    // Objects //
    /////////////

    // Objects are groups of variables.
    // The variables are called properties of the object.
    // Let’s look at how we create objects and give them properties.

    // Create an object with no properties.
    var obj = {};

    // An Object’s properties can be of any type, just like other variables.
    // Let’s add some to our empty object.
    obj.x = 10;
    obj.y = 20.5;
    obj.name = "First Object";

    // Now we will create an object with some initial properties.
    var friendObj = {
        x: 5,
        y: 5,
        name: "Friendly Object"
    };

    // Properties really can be of any type, including other objects.
    obj.friend = friendObj;

    console.log(obj);

    ///////////////////////////////
    // Conditions and repetition //
    ///////////////////////////////

    // We can use conditional statements like "if" to run code based on a boolean value.
    // If the statement is true, the code inside the braces will run, otherwise, the program
    // will move on to the next part of the conditional statement or your program.
    if (five > 5) {
        console.log("`five` est plus grand que 5");
    }
    else if (five === 5) {
        console.log("`five` est la meme que 5");
    }
    else if (five < 5) {
        console.log("`five` est plus petit que 5");
    }
    else {
        console.log("`five` n'est pas numerique.");
    }

    // We can also use conditions to run things many times using
    // javascripts loop constructs: "while", and "for"

    // While will run the code inside its braces repeatedly as long
    // as its condition is true.
    var i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
        console.log("Counting up in a while-loop");
        i += 1;
    }

    // For-loops are very similar to while-loops,
    // but they wrap up the creation of the counter variable,
    // its comparison check, and its change.
    for (var i = 0; i < 5; i += 1) {
        console.log("Counting up in a for-loop.");
    }

    // Loops are handy for doing things repeatedly, but they're also very useful
    // when dealing with data that is stored in an array.
    // An array is a special type of object in javascript whose property names are
    // all numbers.

    // An array starts out like an object, but it uses square brackets.
    var arr = [];
    // We can push things to the back of the array:
    arr.push("Hi");
    arr.push("friend");
    arr.push("Goodbye.");
    // Since the properties are numbers, we need to access them a little differently
    // than we did with our object (arr.0 just won't work):
    arr[0] = "Bonjour";
    arr[2] = "Au revoir.";

    // If we know what to put in our array when we create it, we can do that, too
    var arrTwo = ["a", "b", "c", "d"];

    // We can use a for-loop to do something with everything in our array:
    for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
        console.log("Reading", arr[i]);
    }

    // We can also use other styles of for-loops in javascript, if you like.
    // They can be confusing to keep track of, but they work similarly to our for-loop with a counter.
    for (var index in arr) {
        console.log(index, ":", arr[index]);
    }

    for (var thing of arr) {
        console.log(thing);
    }
