# Cadavre Exquis

This is a framework for exquisite corpse drawings in javascript.

The framework randomly selects scenes to display next to each other. Players can cycle
through the scenes by clicking on them.

## To add a new drawing:
1. Create a new scene in the "scenes/" directory by duplicating "template.js".
2. Rename the file and change the name of the variable it creates to match the filename.
3. Add the name of your scene to the list of scenes in "settings.js"
4. Reload "index.html" in your browser.
