Hello. Today we will take time to develop our own procedural content generators. These can be physical objects or pieces of software: what you make is up to you.

THINK (15 min)
--------------
To get started, we’ll take a bit of time to think through ideas. First, I’d like everyone to write down an idea of what they would like to do on paper. Then, take ten minutes or so to sketch out the idea and how you think you might make it work. I will keep track of time so you don't need to.

PAIR/SHARE (40 min)
-------------------
Now that you have written down your idea, share it with the person sitting next to you. Again, take ten minutes or so to talk through the challenges and possibilities of each others’ ideas. Once you are done, we will go around the room and one person from each pair will share the ideas they talked about. If there are technical challenges you don't feel confident tackling yourself, share those with the group, since someone else might want to work with you to solve them throughout the day.

FORM GROUPS (15 min)
--------------------
Those are some great ideas. If you would like to work in a group with someone else, talk with them now.

I will be around all day. Let’s start making things!
