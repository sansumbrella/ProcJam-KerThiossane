# ProcJam Workshop at Kër Thiossane

ProcJam (short for procedural jam) is an international "game jam" where people make things that make things. These things can be software that generates images, stories, or game levels. They could also be physical projects, such as a board game with dynamic layout, a wind chime (thing that makes music), or a set of rules for how to draw something. We will meet on two days to participate in ProcJam and share ideas with each other and the wider ProcJam community.

On Friday, we will get into the spirit of ProcJam through a series of exercises and examples demonstrating techniques for procedurally generating drawings. We will make drawings first by hand on paper, then we will see how to make similar drawings in a web browser using the javascript programming language.

On Saturday, we will produce our own procedural projects. Come in with an idea to make yourself or work with others to realize a procedural project. People with knowledge of design and javascript will be on hand to help out with project conceptualization and realisation.

Through participating in ProcJam, you will learn the basics of writing code in javascript as well as some modern design fundamentals.
